# Advanced Programming

In this repository we are going to talk about important topics that students need to know
when they are taking ```Advanced Programming``` course. Since we are using ```Java``` in
```AP``` course, we are going to talk about ```OOP```, ```Clean coding```, and other computer
subjects.

Be sure to read each stage before going to next stages. You can also check the resources at the end
of this page. There are some code samples, websites, and etc, in order to help you write code.
