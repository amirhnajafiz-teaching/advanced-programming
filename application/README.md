# How to design an application?

In order to design an application you need find your users and their requirements.
So before you start coding, try to find the users and user ```inputs``` and ```outputs```.
It's good to put these data into diagrams so you can code based on those.

## Example (Snapp!)

If we take a look at ```Snapp!``` we can see that in this application we have 3 type of users.

- Driver
- Passenger
- Admin (monitors the system for customer support)

### What do users need? (finding requirements)

#### example scenario

A ```passenger``` wants to ```take a cab```. Driver should see users ```requests```.
Driver can ```accept``` a passenger. Passenger should ```see``` the driver information.
Passenger should ```pay``` to driver when the journey is finished.

From the above scenario we can find the logic of our application, what tools we need,
how to implement our application, and what to implement.
