# Using files and I/O

File handling is an important part of any application.
```Java``` has several methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting files.

The File class from the ```java.io``` package, allows us to work with files.
To use the File class, create an object of the class, and specify the filename or directory name.

```java
import java.io.File;  // Import the File class

File myObj = new File("filename.txt"); // Specify the filename
```
