# How to read a project manual?

When you want to read a long project manual, don't pay attention to details at first.
Try to read the manual 3 or 4 times. Start from abstract items and then add details in
final stages.

Pay attention to ```verbs```, and ```subjects```. Usually ```subjects``` become entities (class) in your
program. ```verbs``` are these entities actions (methods).

## Example (Telegram)

As a user I want to send messages to my friends. I want to see my contacts. I should be able to
create a new chat or delete an existing one. I want to set an avatar for my personal profile.
I want to be able to report a chat or block a person.

### Entities (classes)

- ```user```
- ```message```
- ```contact```
- ```chat```
- ```profile```

### Actions

- ```send message```
- ```see contacts```
- ```create chat```
- ```delete chat```
- ```set avatar```
- ```report chat```
- ```block person```

## What's next?

After we read the manual, and we created some documents, we can decide about how to implement our application.
We have to choose a method for developing. We need to create our ```packages```, ```classes```, ```interface```, and etc.
